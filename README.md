## Classifier

This is a simple hand-written digit classifer build with a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Jupyter Notebook. 
The files contain the script used to produce the model as well as the model itself. The model was later brough into an Android application in which a user can write a digit on the phone and have it be classified. That project can be found here: [NumberClassifier](https://github.com/Elijah-Dangerfield/NumberClassifier)
